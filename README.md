# AUTO PLOT MAKER , PREDICTOR AND CLASSIFIER - Binayak jha

This project is made from,

1) Matplotlib
2) Pandas
3) Scikit Learn
4) Pyautogui
5) More to be added.

This project makes easier to make plots, You just have to give your csv/ xlsx file name.
After you give the <b>csv / xlsx file name</b> it will search the file in you computer,

After the file is found it sends the data for further process.

Here, In this box you should enter the data table heading which you want to show in the x-axis of the plot. for eg: In my covid.csv file I have three table heading, 1) Date 2) New Cases 3) Deaths

| Date | New Cases | Deaths |
| ---- | --------- | ------ |
| 15   | 1782      | 33     |
| 16   | 2006      | 43     |
| 17   | 1310      | 21     |
| 18   | 1223      | 21     |
| ...  | ....      | ...    |



Here, I kept 'Date' as my <b>X-axis</b> data,

And, 'New Cases' as my <b>Y-axis,</b>

After that, You will get another prompt of keeping<b> X-axis heading</b> which will be shown below the X-axis indicating what value is on X-axis,

Now, You will be asked <b>Y-axis Heading,</b>

After This, You will have to choose a type of graph you want Like I want to see a Plot Graph,

Now you can close the graph( you will get the option to save it after seeing it),

Here, you can save the graph in both <b>png</b> or <b>jpg</b> format.

After, this you will see another prompt asking if you want to see other things like mean, median, mode, etc
